Therefore, it is important that you carefully read and understand these terms before using the app. You are prohibited from copying or modifying the app, its components, or our trademarks in any way.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Attempting to extract the app&#39;s source code, translating it into other languages, or creating derivative versions is also strictly prohibited. The app and all of its associated intellectual property rights, including trademarks, copyrights, and database rights, remain the property of Daniil Muraveyko.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We are dedicated to making the app as useful and efficient as possible. Therefore, we reserve the right to modify the app or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. Rest assured that we will always be transparent about any fees associated with the app or its services.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The AffiMe app collects and processes personal data that you have provided to us to provide our services. It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your phone and access to the app. We recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone – the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device – as this may make your phone vulnerable to malware, viruses, and other malicious programs. Jailbreaking or rooting your phone may also compromise your phone&#39;s security features and may result in the AffiMe app not functioning properly or at all.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The app utilizes third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. You can find the links to the Terms and Conditions of these third-party service providers in the app</p><ul id="l1"><li data-list-text="•"><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: -9pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">RevenueCat</p></li></ul><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Please be aware that there are certain things for which Daniil Muraveyko cannot take responsibility. Some features of the app require an active internet connection, which can be provided by either Wi-Fi or your mobile network provider. However, we cannot be held responsible if the app does not function fully without Wi-Fi or if you have run out of data allowance.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">If you are using the app outside of a Wi-Fi area, your mobile network provider&#39;s terms of agreement will still apply, and you may be charged for mobile data usage while accessing the app or incur other third-party charges. By using the app, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the app, please ensure that you have received permission from the bill payer to use the app.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In addition, Daniil Muraveyko cannot take responsibility for the way in which you use the app. It is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged, as we cannot accept responsibility if the device runs out of battery and you are unable to use the app.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Regarding Daniil Muraveyko&#39;s responsibility for your use of the app, please keep in mind that while we make every effort to ensure that the app is updated and accurate at all times, we rely on third parties to provide us with information that we can then make available to you. Daniil Muraveyko assumes no liability for any direct or indirect loss that you may experience as a result of relying solely on the app&#39;s functionality.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At some point, there may be updates to the app. The app is currently available on iOS, but the system requirements (as well as any additional systems that we may decide to extend the app&#39;s availability to) may change. If you want to continue using the app, you will need to download the updates. Please note that Daniil Muraveyko does not guarantee that the app will always be updated to remain relevant to you or to function with the iOS version installed on your device.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">However, you agree to always accept updates to the app when they are offered to you. Furthermore, we may decide to discontinue providing the app and terminate its use at any time without prior notice. Unless otherwise stated, upon termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you under these terms will cease; (b) you must stop using the app and, if necessary, delete it from your device.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h2><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is possible that I may update our Terms and Conditions periodically. Therefore, it is recommended that you review this page occasionally to stay up-to-date on any changes. Any modifications will be communicated by posting the updated Privacy Policy on this page.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">This policy is effective as of 2023-07-12</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Contact Us</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a href="mailto:affirmeapp@gmail.com" class="a" target="_blank">If you have any questions or suggestions about Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at </a><a href="mailto:rmeapp@gmail.com" class="a" target="_blank">affi</a><a href="mailto:rmeapp@gmail.com" target="_blank">rmeapp@gmail.com</a></p></body></html>
